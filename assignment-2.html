    <h1>Keyboard</h1>

    <p>
        Keyboards on laptops and notebook computers usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke, shorter over travel distance, and a reduced set of keys. They may not have a numeric keypad, 
        and the function keys may be placed in locations that differ from their placement on a standard, full-sized keyboard.
        The switch mechanism for a laptop keyboard is more likely to be a scissor switch than a rubber dome; this is opposite the trend for full-size keyboards.
        Flexible keyboards are a junction between normal type and laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows the user to fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer.
        However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority[10] of flexible keyboards in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water- and dust-proof. This is useful in hospitals,[11] where keyboards are subjected to frequent washing, and other dirty or must-be-clean environments.

   <h1>What is mouse</h1>

    <p>
        A mouse is a small device that a computer user pushes across a desk surface in order to point to a place on a display screen and to select one or more actions to take from that position. 
        The mouse first became a widely used computer tool when Apple Computer made it a standard part of the Apple Macintosh.
        Today, the mouse is an integral part of the graphical user interface (GUI) of any PC. The mouse apparently got its name by being about the same size and color as a toy mouse.
        Mice typically have two buttons, a scroll wheel and a laser sensor. They are used to move the cursor on the screen, select objects and click on buttons.

    <h1>About my diary</h1>

    <p>
        This morning I woke up at 6 AM. I did some studying.Then around 10:45 AM I sat in front of my computer again.
        I got ready for my 11 AM online class. After my 11 AM class, I made a cup of coffee for myself. Then at 12:30 PM, I started another class. At 1:45 PM  I was done with my afternoon class. Then I took a shower and washed some clothes. After I got out of the shower I ate some light snacks. I donâ€™t usually eat lunch if I eat breakfast late.

   <h1>Pen</h1>

   <p>
    A pen is a writing instrument used to apply ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing.
    Historically, reed pens, quill pens, and dip pens were used, with a nib dipped in ink. Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used. Modern types include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain and felt or ceramic tip pens.
