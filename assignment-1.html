    <h1>What is Selectors</h1>

    <p>
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
        
        Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
        Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
        Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
        Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    </p>  
    
    <h1>What is Margin</h1>

    <p>
        Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
