                        The Siberian Husky, a truly striking dog breed, has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, who first originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks. It’s also important to mention this athletic, intelligent breed can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents. Sadly, many of these dogs end up in shelters because they can require more patience and care than some are willing to give.

Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a yard with a high fence that goes all the way into the ground to prevent escapes. They are also known to tunnel under fences, so be sure your fence is escape-proof! Giving your Husky enough exercise may prove easier said than done; though, it’ll reduce boredom and unwanted behaviors, like digging or chewing. Siberian Huskies are pack animals, so they need to be part of a family or group. They are very social dogs, and they love to be around people. Siberian huskies are also very intelligent, and they enjoy learning new things.

                                Huskies need exercise and A LOT of it. If you don’t give your pupper enough exercise, you will have an indoor tornado!
They are extremely smart, so they need constant mental stimulation. That’s the only way to keep the Husky-branded mischief at bay. 
They are dramatic and they demand attention in very creative ways. 
They do not bark much, but they are expert howlers.
They will howl during brushing, grooming, bathing, drying, travelling, playing, and especially during your meetings. 
You need to brush them at least twice a week with steel combs or deShedders. Or, you will have fur everywhere – couch, bed, pillow, kitchen, wardrobe…you get the drift!
