        <h1> Bullet </h1>
        <p>
            Early bullets were round lead balls that were loaded down the muzzle of smoothbore weapons and propelled by
            the
            ignition of a physically separate charge of black powder. Modern bullets developed in the 19th century for
            use
            in small arms that had rifled barrels. In these rifles, a system of helical grooves cut into the interior
            surface of the gun’s bore imparts spin to the bullet during its passage. The spin enablea bullet to maintain
            a
            point-forward attitude in flight, and under these conditions, an elongated bullet with a pointed tip is
            aerodynamically much superior to a round ball; it sustains its velocity much better in flight, thereby
            gaining
            in both accuracy and range.
